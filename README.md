# red-jedi
 
 > red-jedi is a platform for college students to compete in OPEN SOURCE . A leaderboard highlights the top contributors weekly and monthly . So everyone just grab your *caffeine* and go mad with your codes , coz you can be The One (hope you have seen the Matrix). 
 Developers can view language-specific leaderboard also , so we can have our Python Yoda or Js Ninja in college too. Sounds Fun !!

## To Run the Project -

```http-server -c-1 -o -a localhost -p 8000```
